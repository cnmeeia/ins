If White Pocket and the Wave had a baby, it would be the North and South Teepees. 

Yesterday I posted a reel about finding trails when when you don’t score the permit for that sought after area. 

This is one hike we discovered after researching alternatives when we didn’t get a permit to the wave, again. 

Areas that are popular and permitted are for a good reason. They are amazing but I found there are so many incredible adventures to be had that fly under the radar. If you’re just willing to do a little research. 

What adventures have you discovered when you didn’t win that permit?
