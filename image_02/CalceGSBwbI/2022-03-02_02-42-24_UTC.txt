A circular economy is an all-encompassing approach to life and business that aims to create more value and less waste out of the resources we use. 
ðŸŸ¢ Say no to plastic! The most important part of the circular economy is to say no to waste producing items first.
ðŸŸ¢ Hit the Op Shops. Op shops are an absolute gold mine for quality pieces of used clothing. In the world of fast fashion, there is nothing better than taking a moment to slow down a find a gem in a thrift shop.
ðŸŸ¢ Compost at home. The real benefit of composting is that is creates an environment that doesnâ€™t cause methane and other harmful gases in the breakdown process.
ðŸŸ¢ Repair and Have Parties. If your shoes need a new sole, donâ€™t throw them out. Take them to a classic cobbler and get them fixed.
